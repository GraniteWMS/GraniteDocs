# WebDesktop
![Local Image](./webdesktop.jpg)

The Granite WebDesktop is constructed on a thick client architecture, where the software application operates primarily on the user's device (like a computer or mobile device) and conducts a substantial amount of processing locally. This approach minimizes reliance on server processing and data retrieval for enhanced efficiency.

The central functionality of the system revolves around data **maintenance** and **enquiry**. This relies on various Granite APIs to efficiently perform these tasks.
