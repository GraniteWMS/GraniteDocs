# Customization

## Introduction

Granite WMS prides itself on offering not only extensive customization options but also solutions of the highest quality. By leveraging robust programming languages in combination with flexible database schemas, we deliver an innovative and unique suite of customization tools. Our approach ensures that we remain free from technology debt while also addressing backward compatibility concerns. Programming languages, being more stable and less prone to rapid obsolescence compared to technology trends, enable us to build a future-proof system.

This forward-thinking strategy ensures that Granite WMS avoids the pitfalls of outdated technology and maintains a seamless user experience. In essence, we’ve embraced customization the right way—empowering you to tailor our solutions to your exact needs without compromising on stability or quality.

Much of this customization is supported directly in the frontend user interface (WebDesktop), allowing you to configure and manage setups efficiently within the application. For areas where frontend support is not yet available, we ensure comprehensive documentation is provided to guide you through the process. Our commitment to continual improvement means that we are constantly expanding frontend support, ensuring that Granite WMS remains versatile and user-friendly.
