# Customization

## Introduction

Granite WMS prides itself on offering not only extensive customization options but also solutions of the highest quality. By leveraging robust programming languages in combination with flexible database schemas, we deliver an innovative and unique suite of customization tools. Our approach ensures that we remain free from technology debt while also addressing backward compatibility concerns. Programming languages, being more stable and less prone to rapid obsolescence compared to technology trends, enable us to build a future-proof system.
In essence, we’ve embraced customization the right way—empowering you to tailor our solutions to your exact needs without compromising on stability or quality.

Much of this customization is supported directly in the frontend user interface (WebDesktop), allowing you to configure and manage setups efficiently within the application. For areas where frontend support is not yet available, we ensure comprehensive documentation is provided to guide you through the process. 

## At a glance

### Process and Steps
`Our business process workflow engine.`

**Low-code** data-driven workflow. Step behavior is driven by **T-SQL** pre-scripts.
UI design is driven by **HTML** and **Handlebars** known as WebTemplates.


### WebDesktop Data Capture 
`Custom data entry`

**No-code** **data-driven** setup to add custom data capture screens. These screens map one-to-one to webDesktop screens and utilize same API operation.


### WebDesktop Functions
`Custom Injectable functions`
Similar to Data Capture except instead of calling an API operation you implement a custom **T-SQL** script.


### SQL CLR
`T-SQL utility`

SQL **CLR** is utilized to enhance the **T-SQL** experience, we have a comprehensive set of functions to interact with our APi s, utilities etc. This ensure that the same logic is used in T-SQL via our API s and that T-SQL is not depended on technologies.
