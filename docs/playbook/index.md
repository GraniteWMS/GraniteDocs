The Granite Playbook is a structured guide to our implementation methodology, designed to reduce risk, create value, and ensure repeatability in every project.


# Security policies requested

**Client:** _Our IT team requires security information._

`This request can arise for various reasons. The IT administrator might need details to set up and commission resources for us, or the client may need to comply with industry standards and security regulations. Understanding the purpose of the request helps us respond effectively.`

**Actions:** 
1. **Send email** with a link to our **Security Policies and Measure** page.
2. In email ask client what the **requirement/reason** is for them asking this information.
3. **Offer assistance** by suggesting a meeting with a consultant if they need further explanation. 

We are not required to fill in any documentation or answer any questions, and you want to avoid this.
We should always insist on a online meeting with all relevant parties to walk the client through our security policies. 

**Process Overview**
This process is simple yet value-driven. We recognize that many organizations must adhere to strict security policies, and our goal is to:

✔ Understand why the information is being requested.

✔ Provide the necessary security details.

✔ Ensure the client has access to further assistance if needed.
