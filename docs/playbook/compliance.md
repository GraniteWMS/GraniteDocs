# Vendor Compliance Approach ‚Äì Granite WMS

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines our approach as a vendor to supporting compliance, governance, and security best practices within the Granite WMS platform. It is intended to guide both our internal team and our clients in understanding the shared responsibility model we use to maintain secure, reliable, and auditable systems.

> **Note:**  
> Our goal is **not to comply with every formal standard**, but to follow widely accepted **best practices and guidelines** that align with frameworks like COBIT, ISO 27001, NIST, and others. We aim to provide a secure and well-governed system while allowing flexibility for our clients‚Äô specific compliance needs.

## 2. Our Compliance Philosophy

We recognize that system compliance is a shared responsibility between the vendor (us) and the client (you). We aim to:

- Provide the **technical controls, features, and logging** required to support your compliance frameworks.
- Maintain **secure coding and system design standards**.
- Collaborate with clients to support **audit preparation**, **incident response**, and **governance processes**.

## 3. Shared Responsibility Model

Compliance is a joint effort. Here's how we define responsibilities:
