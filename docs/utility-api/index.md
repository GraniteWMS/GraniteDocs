# Utility API

The Utility API is home to various services that enhance Granite's capabilities.

At the moment it is comprised of:

	Provides easy ways of interacting with SSRS.

- 	[__SQL Export Service__](sql-export-service.md)

	Enables simpler excel exports from SQL tables and views.

- 	[__Email Service__](email-service.md)
