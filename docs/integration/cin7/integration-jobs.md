# Integration Jobs

!!! note
    This documentation is a work in progress and is intended to show the development progress of the integration with CIN7. As such, it may be subject to change as progress is made. 

Integration jobs are a special type of [Scheduler](../../scheduler/manual.md) job called [injected jobs](../../scheduler/manual.md#injected-jobs-integration-jobs). 
See below for information for specifics on how document and master data jobs work.

## How it works

As CIN7 is an online only service, all data is fetched directly from CIN7's API.
