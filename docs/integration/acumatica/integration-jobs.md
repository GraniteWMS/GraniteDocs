# Integration Jobs

Integration jobs are a special type of [Scheduler](../../scheduler/manual.md) job called [injected jobs](../../scheduler/manual.md#injected-jobs-integration-jobs).

## How it works
### Document Jobs
All data is currently fetched through Acumatica's Rest API. 

GraniteScheduler runs injected jobs that check the IntegrationDocumentQueue for the lastUpdated time for the relevant document type(if no lastUpdated time is found it will use current time - 24hours). With this last updated time, it will then do a get request on Acumatica's API for all relevant documents that have a last updated time greater than the lastUpdated time from the IntegrationDocumentQueue. If there are any document that fit those criteria they are inserted into the IntegrationDocumentQueue. The job then runs this queue.

When a record with Status 'ENTERED' is found, the job uses the API to fetch the information related to that document from the Acumatica and apply the changes to the Granite document. 

All valid changes to data in the Granite tables are logged to the Audit table, showing the previous value and the new value.

If a change is made in the ERP system that would put Granite into an invalid state, no changes are applied. Instead, the ERPSyncFailed field is set to true and the ERPSyncFailedReason field shows the reason for the failure. The IntegrationLog table will contain further details on the failure if applicable.

#### Document Statuses

For Sales Orders the statuses are mapped in the following way:

| Acumatica Status | Granite Status | 
|------------------|----------------|
| Back Order, Open | ENTERED |
| Expired, Canceled, Rejected | CANCELLED | 
| On Hold, Credit Hold, Risk Hold, Pending Approval, Pending Processing | ONHOLD |
| Completed, Invoiced, Shipping | COMPLETE |

For Purchase Orders the statuses are mapped in the following way:

| Acumatica Status | Granite Status | 
|------------------|----------------|
| Open | ENTERED |
| Canceled, Rejected | CANCELLED |
| On hold, Pending Approval, Pending Email, Pending Printing | ONHOLD |
| Completed, Closed | COMPLETED|

For Transfers and Receipts the statuses are mapped in the following way:

| Acumatica Status | Granite Status | 
|------------------|----------------|
| Balanced | ENTERED |
| On hold | ONHOLD |
| Released | COMPLETED|

### Master data jobs
MasterItems has its own Job. This Job fetches all StockItems from the Acumatica Rest API and compares them to the MasterItems in Granite. Any inserts / updates are done as required. 

The document jobs also sync changes to the MasterItems that are on the document. This means that on sites that do not make many changes to their MasterItems it is better to limit running this job to once a day or even less frequently.
