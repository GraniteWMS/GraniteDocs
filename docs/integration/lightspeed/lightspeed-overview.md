## Lightspeed POS vs Traditional ERP (e.g. Sage 300)

| Feature | Lightspeed POS | ERP (e.g. Sage 300) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Retail and shop-floor operations | Full enterprise management |
| **Focus** | POS, inventory, purchasing, e-commerce | Accounting, financials, procurement, operations |
| **Strengths** | Cloud-native, multi-location, user-friendly POS | Deep financials, compliance, wide module coverage |
| **Weaknesses** | Limited accounting, fewer workflows | Complex setup, weaker retail/POS interface |
| **Best For** | Retailers, restaurants, businesses needing fast POS & stock control | Companies needing full back-office financial integration |

ðŸ‘‰ In many setups, Lightspeed handles the **front-end retail operations** (sales, stock, customer transactions), while an ERP like Sage 300 manages the **back-office accounting and financials**.
